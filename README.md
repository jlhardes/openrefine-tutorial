# openrefine-tutorial
Offers sample OpenRefine projects and lessons for trying clean-up tasks, reconciliation to Linked Data, and exporting as RDF.

OpenRefine is a powerful tool but very particular. In this tutorial you will:
* Use a large dataset project to try cleaning tasks
* Use a small dataset project to try reconciling text to Linked Data URIs
  * Map Linked Data for RDF output
